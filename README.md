# RC Justified Gallery

An extremely easy to use gallery plugin for Joomla, built around a beautiful and modern responsive design. Full documentation and latest release available from http://therichcourt.com/joomla/gallery

# Justified Fixed-Width Layout...

Add beautiful edge-to-edge image galleries to your site with clean, crisp edges, without cropping or changing the aspect ratios of your images. The effect is just like what you see on Flickr, Google Photos and the Windows 10 Photos app - why should the big companies be the only ones with such great photo layouts?

# Easy to Use...

It's easy to add RC Justified Gallery to any article on your site, with just three clicks from the article editor. That, plus automatic thumbnail creation, make this an incredibly easy plugin to use - You can get your first galleries up and running in under 2 minutes.

# Responsive...

RC Justified Gallery looks great on all screen sizes, from phones and tablets up to desktop monitors. It also dynamically resizes as the browser window changes size.

# Optional Built-in Shadowbox...

RC Justified Gallery uses a JavaScript shadowbox with minimal styling to view your images, or if you prefer, you can use it with whichever other shadowbox plugin you normally use.

# Customisable...

You can change the image spacing and the size of the rows in your galleries, and choose whether or not to show the image names, depending on your needs.

# Detailed Documentation...

While the plugin is very easy to use, its functions are documented in detail in the extensive user guide.
